# Restaurant Reservation Project

Live Application: https://restaurant-client-mc.herokuapp.com/dashboard

## Database setup

1. Set up four new ElephantSQL database instances - development, test, preview, and production.
1. After setting up your database instances, connect DBeaver to your new database instances.

### Knex

Run `npx knex` commands from within the `back-end` folder, which is where the `knexfile.js` file is located.

## Installation

1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. Run `cp ./back-end/.env.sample ./back-end/.env`.
1. Update the `./back-end/.env` file with the connection URL's to your ElephantSQL database instance.
1. Run `cp ./front-end/.env.sample ./front-end/.env`.
1. You should not need to make changes to the `./front-end/.env` file unless you want to connect to a backend at a location other than `http://localhost:5000`.
1. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
1. Run `npm run start:dev` to start your server in development mode.

If you have trouble getting the server to run, reach out for assistance.

## Running tests

This project has unit, integration, and end-to-end (e2e) tests.
End-to-end tests use browser automation to interact with the application just like the user does.
